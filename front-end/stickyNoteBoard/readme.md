# How to test the log in functionality

First make sure you have Node.js installed as we will need npm for installing the necessary resources/libraries for testing.

After you have installed Node.js make sure you are in the same directory where the package.json file is located.

Then in your console insert the following command into your console to install the resources:

```
npm install
```

After the necessary dependencies were installed, insert the comand below for testing:

```
npm test
```

Please make sure you're not commiting the "node_modules" folder!
